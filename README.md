## Project Insight
The dataset captures total sales, profit, and order quantity for 2009,2010,2011 and 2012 and compared each to its previous year (PY). It includes weekly sales/profit trends, performance by subcategory, and highlights key shifts in top-performing and underperforming products—providing a comprehensive view of commercial performance and operational health
## Final Conclusion:
The project focuses on identifying significant declines in sales and profit in year-over-year, analysing which product subcategories are generating losses (e.g., Tables, Office Machines), monitoring order quantity trends, and revealing weekly fluctuations in performance to support sales planning and strategic inventory adjustments.
